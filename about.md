## About me

I've been programming since I was around 10, learning how to make websites as a very bored 5th grader. Since then, I've expanded my skills to develop and publish games, websites, and web applications.

Recently, I've been doing most of my work in Javascript and Node.JS, though I've worked in a variety of languages including Ruby, Python, and PHP. And Flash, back when Flash games were all the rage.

When I'm not programming, I like drawing, making music, writing, and reading. I also play far too many video games, although I'm not terribly good at them.

You can reach me on [Github](https://github.com/dmliao) or by [email](mailto:dmliao@princeton.edu). I also run [Beast Amorphous](http://beastamorphous.com), a website where I host my games, art, and game-related website work.
