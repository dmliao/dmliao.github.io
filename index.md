# Hi, I'm Diana Liao

I'm a Computer Science student at Princeton University. I'm also a freelance web developer, though I'm currently not taking freelance work.

I've been programming since I was around 10, learning how to make websites as a very bored 5th grader. Since then, I've expanded my skills to develop and publish games, websites, and web applications.

Here's a short list of **[Side Projects](/projects)** I've worked on through the years.

When I'm not programming, I like drawing, making music, writing, and reading. I also play far too many video games, although I'm not terribly good at them.

You can reach me on **[Github](https://github.com/dmliao)** or by **[email](mailto:dmliao@princeton.edu)**. I also run **[Beast Amorphous](http://beastamorphous.com)**, a website where I host my games, art, and game-related website work.
